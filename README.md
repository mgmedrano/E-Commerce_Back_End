# E-Commerce_Back_End

## Background
- The given task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site (starter code provided). 
- As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, so that the company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Employee-Tracker Targets
Given a functional Express.js API
- When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
then they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- When they enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- When they enter the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- When they open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- When they test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
